      # "Note: Workflows triggered by pull_request_target events are run in the context of the base
      # branch. Since the base branch is considered trusted, workflows triggered by these events will always run,
      # REGARDLESS OF APPROVAL SETTINGS."
      # Therefore, membership must be checked to authorize PRs to run workflows.
      #
      # Note: 1. To use this repository's private action, you must check out the repository
      # 2. PRs from external accounts could alter behaviors of the custom actions and execute
      # the altered actions if the head of PR is checked out to use custom actions. Therefore,
      # always checkout the base branch of the PR to use trustful actions before the identity
      # could be verified.
